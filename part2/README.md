# Part II - Challenge hunting

This part of the book can be read from end to end as a _hacking guide_.
Used in that way you will be walked through various types of web
vulnerabilities and learn how to exploit their occurrences in the Juice
Shop application. Alternatively you can start hacking the Juice Shop on
your own and use this part simply as a reference and _source of hints_
in case you get stuck at a particular challenge.

In case you want to look up hints for a particular challenge, the
following table lists all challenges of the OWASP Juice Shop in the same
order as on the Score Board.

> The challenge hints found in this release of the companion guide are
> compatible with `{{book.juiceShopVersion}}` of OWASP Juice Shop.
