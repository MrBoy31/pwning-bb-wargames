# Introduction

![Welcome!](.gitbook/assets/welcome%20%281%29.gif)

This is the official companion guide to the **Fruity Bank** application. Being a web application with a vast number of intended security vulnerabilities, the Bad Bank is supposed to be the opposite of a _best practice_ or _template application_ for web developers: It is an awareness, training, demonstration and exercise tool for security risks in modern web applications. 

_This game is a mod of the excellent OWASP Juice Shop - written by_ [_Bj√∂rn Kimminich_](http://kimminich.de/)_. For full_   _immersion and to have some fun we will refer to the Juice Shop in the documentation as the '_**Fruity** _**Bank Shop**' - in order to get the full experience. Please note this is a condensed version to help gamers get up to spend quickly. Have fun!_

The book is divided into two parts:

## Part I - Hacking preparations

Part one helps you to get the application running and to set up optional hacking tools.

## Part II - Challenge hunting

Part two gives an overview of the vulnerabilities found in the OWASP Juice Shop including hints how to find and exploit them in the application.

## Disclaimer

_Please be aware that this book is not supposed to be a comprehensive introduction to Web Application Security in general. For every category of vulnerabilities present in the **Bad Bank Shop** you will find a brief explanation - typically by quoting and referencing to existing content on the given topic._
