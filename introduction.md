# Introduction

![Welcome](.gitbook/assets/welcome.gif)

This is the official companion guide to the **E. Corp** **Shop** application. Being a web application with a vast number of intended security vulnerabilities, the E. Corp Shop is supposed to be the opposite of a _best practice_ or _template application_ for web developers: It is an awareness, training, demonstration and exercise tool for security risks in modern web applications.

_This game is a mod of the excellent_ [_OWASP Juice Shop_](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project) _- written by_ _Bj√∂rn Kimminich. For full_ _immersion and to have some fun we will refer to the Juice Shop in the documentation as the '_**E. Corp** **Shop**_' - in order to get the full experience. Please note this is a condensed version to help gamers get up to spend quickly. Have fun!_

The book is divided into three parts:

## Part I - Hacking preparations

Part one helps you to get the application running and to set up optional hacking tools.

## Part II - Challenge hunting

Part two gives an overview of the vulnerabilities found in the **E. Corp** **Shop** including hints how to find and exploit them in the application.

## Part III - Next Level {#part-iii-next-level}

Part three covers what comes next... what can you do to keep playing and learning new tricks. Well, have we got a surprise for you...!

Corp** **Shop** _you will find a brief explanation - typically by quoting and referencing to existing content on the given topic._
