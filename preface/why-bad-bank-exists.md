# Why Bad Bank exists

To the unsuspecting user the **Bad Bank shop** just looks like a small online shop which sells - _surprise!_ - bank things and associated products. Except for the entirely overrated payment and delivery aspect of the e-commerce business, the **Bad Bank** is fully functional. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. The **Bad Bank** contains  challenges of varying difficulty where you are supposed to exploit underlying security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities were intentionally planted in the application for exactly that purpose, but in a way that actually happens in "real-life" web development as well!

Your hacking progress is tracked by the application using immediate push notifications for successful exploits as well as a score board for progress overview. Finding this score board is actually one of the \(easiest\) challenges! The idea behind this is to utilize [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) techniques to motivate you to get as many challenges solved as possible - similar to unlocking achievements in many modern video games.

Apart from the hacker and awareness training use case, penetration testing tools and automated security scanners are invited to use **Bad Bank** as a sort of guinea pig-application to check how well their products cope with JavaScript-heavy application frontends and REST APIs.
