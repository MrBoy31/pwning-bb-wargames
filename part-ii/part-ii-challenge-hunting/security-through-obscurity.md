# Security through Obscurity

Many applications contain content which is not supposed to be publicly accessible. A properly implemented authorization model would ensure that only users _with appropriate permission_ can access such content. If an application instead relies on the fact that the content is _not visible anywhere_, this is called "security through obscurity" which is a severe anti-pattern:

> In security engineering, security through obscurity \(or security by obscurity\) is the reliance on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system. A system or component relying on obscurity may have theoretical or actual security vulnerabilities, but its owners or designers believe that if the flaws are not known, that will be sufficient to prevent a successful attack. Security experts have rejected this view as far back as 1851, and advise that obscurity should never be the only security mechanism.
